# 1.4.3 Changing your preferences

  
## I.4.3.1 Changing user preferences
To change your user preferences go the dashboard and click 'My Info', located at the top towards the left:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3a.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3a.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

Most of the settings are self-explanatory:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3b.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3b.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

The 'Text Editor' setting will determine how you edit the text for your pages and entries. For most users 'Wysiwyg" (which is short for 'What You See Is What You Get') will do just fine, so if you don't know what any of the available options mean just leave the setting as it is. To test if it works, let's change the language setting. For everybody's convenience let's use a widely spoken language, like Romanian:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3c.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3c.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
 
Now, if you return to the 'Tabla Principala' (which, of course, is Romanian for Dashboard), you'll see that everything is the same except for the language:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3d.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3d.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

Apparantly, the Romanian translation still needs some work because some stuff still appears in English but let's all agree that any self-respecting Romanian user could probably work with this. -And be glad we didn't pick Japanese because then we'd have to call a nearby Japanese restaurant to find out how to get back to our settings.

  
## I.4.3.2 The configuration page

  
Many more settings can be changed in the configuration page. To get there, click 'Administration' in the top-menu of the Dashboard, then click 'Configuration' in the sub-menu:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3e.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3e.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

There's a lot we can change here, and luckily it's divided up in different tabs. In the 'Common Settings' tab we finally find out where to change the site name, so while we're here let's do just that. 

<a href="/images/img1-4-3f.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3f.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

Notice the little blue icons with an 'i' in them. They will help you understand the settings by showing you a tooltip when you have your mouse pointer on them:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3g.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3g.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


<p class="note" markdown="1">**Note:** Some settings are not as harmless as they look. Please read the tooltips if you don't know what the setting does, and if you're not sure, do not change it! Try to read the documentation or search the support forum for more information and if that doesn't help, post a topic on the support forum.  
Because most of the settings speak for themselves, we can skip most of them here. There are two things that are important though, and we'll take a look at those now.</p>

  
  
First of all, the ***debug*** tab. If you click on the debug tab, you'll see the following settings:

<a href="/images/img1-4-3h.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3h.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


The debug mode setting can be very important if there's some problem with your PivotX installation. If you swich debug mode on, PivotX will give you debugging information, which can be very helpful in solving the problem. If it's all Greek to you, it might still be useful to people trying to help you on the support forum.  
  
The second setting that's worth pointing out is in the 'File Uploads' tab. Remember when we entered the popup with a thumbnail in Chapter 4.1? The size of that thumbnail can be changed here with 'Thumbnail Width' and 'Thumbnail Height':

<a href="/images/img1-4-3i.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-3i.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>
