# 1.3 Setting up the first user 

After you've uploaded the files to your webserver, like described in the last 
chapter, you're ready to set up the first user. Just use your webbrowser to go 
to the location to which you've uploaded the files, and you'll be redirected 
to the screen where you can set up the first user and database connection.

Follow the on-screen instructions, and you're good to go!

(Yes, we know this is a bit brief. More detailed instructions will follow shortly)
