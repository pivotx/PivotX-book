# 1.4.2 Setting a different Theme

  
When you change the settings for your weblog to a different theme, the look of our website will change. To make your life easier, there are some pre-fabricated themes available on [http://themes.pivotx.net][1] . For this example, we'll use the 'Earthly Calm' theme.  
  
After downloading the theme, unzip the file, and upload the 'earthlycalm' folder and everything that's in it to your webserver. The folder has to go in the ***pivotx/templates/*** directory on your webserver, like this:  

<img src="/images/img1-4-2a.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

Depending on what program you use to upload the theme folder, it might look a little different, but hopefully you get the idea.

  
  
In the dashboard, go to the topmenu, and select 'Administration' and 'Weblogs': 

<a href="/images/img1-4-2b.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2b.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


The following screen gives you a list of the weblogs you have. We haven't done anything here yet, so there should be only one weblog. Now click the 'Edit' button for that weblog: 

<a href="/images/img1-4-2c.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2c.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


And this is where you edit your Weblog. While we're here, let's change some other stuff too. Let's change the name and the payoff first. There is no 'Save Settings' button, in case you were wondering. As soon as you've made these changes, they take effect automatically.  
  
The language setting here will NOT change the language of the Dashboard. It will change the format for dates and numbers on your website.

  
<a href="/images/img1-4-2d.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2d.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


When you're done, click on the 'Templates' tab. You should see the following screen: 

<a href="/images/img1-4-2e.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2e.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


Let's change these settings to the appropriate templates of the 'Earthly Calm' theme: 

<a href="/images/img1-4-2f.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2f.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


Since 'Earthly Calm' does not have a separate file for the 'Archivepage Template', pick the *frontpage_template.html* file for that, so your settings look like this after you're done:  

<a href="/images/img1-4-2g.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2g.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


These setting are automatically 'saved', so if you go to the frontpage of your website now, it should look like this: 

<a href="/images/img1-4-2h.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4-2h.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot" /></a>


Cool! That wasn't too hard, was it? Of course, everybody wants to have their own unique look for their own website. The pre-fab themes can help you on your way with that.

  
  
In a later stage, you'll find out that changing the look of your website is not very hard either. Some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS should be enough to alter the themes and templates to your liking. If you don't have that knowledge, this might be a good place to start learning: [http://www.w3schools.com/html/DEFAULT.asp][2]
