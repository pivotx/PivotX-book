# 1.8 Adding and administering Users

_This is a first draft._

Adding and administering of Users can be done through the Dashboard (Administration / Users).  
Adding a new user is quite straightforward. The userlevel needs some more explanation.

The regular userlevels possible are:

1. Normal
2. Advanced
3. Administrator
4. Superadmin

What can each userlevel do?
---------------------------

In general every userlevel can do the same as the userlevel that is lower in level.

1. __Normal__  
   View entries/pages  
   Write entries in user assigned categories (selected per user) and pages in any chapter  
   Delete own entries/pages  
   _Comments (can only view overview?)_  
   _Trackbacks?_  

2. __Advanced__  
   Manage media (images only)  
   Edit/delete comments  
   Edit/delete entries/pages of lower level users  
   _Trackbacks?_  

3. __Administrator__  
   Install/manage extensions and widgets  
   Create categories/weblogs/chapters  
   Manage all media  
   Configuration  
   Create/delete users of lower level  
   Edit registered visitors  
   Maintenance   

4. __Superadmin__  
   Receive notification on registered visitors (only the first superadmin alphabetically)  
   Change author and last edited  
   Can use all existing categories  
   Create/delete users at all levels  
   
Special userlevels
------------------

There are 2 special userlevels:

1. __Moblogger__   
   Meant for user(s) when you activate Moblogging.  
   _Nothing can be done directly? Gets logged out automatically?_
2. __Inactive__  
   Can be used to (temporarily) disable an existing user.
