# 1.4 Using PivotX at a glance 

So you've installed PivotX and set up your first user. Great! Now it's time to add some content to your website.

If you visit your PivotX website at this point, you should see the the default front page which looks like this:  

<a href="/images/img1-4a.jpg" class="fancybox"><img src="/images/img1-4a.jpg" width="400" alt="Screenshot of frontpage." /></a>

Left you see the 'Welcome to PivotX..." message. This is what's called an entry. Entries are frequently updated parts of your website, which is the whole idea behind blogging.

To the right you see a section called 'Pages' with a list of pages that've been published. After a successful installation, there should be two pre-made pages, 'Welcome' and 'About PivotX'. Pages are the more or less static parts of your website, as their content isn't dynamic and hardly ever changes. Bloggers often use these for information about themselves.

In order to familiarize yourself with the different parts of your website, try browsing around in the default installation for a while.

After that we'll begin with posting our first entry!
