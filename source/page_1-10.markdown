# 1.10 Working with Extensions

You can extend the functionality of PivotX by installing extensions.
Visit the [PivotX Extensions site][1] and see what extensions are available.

When you have found the extension you want, download the zip file (using the
Download button). Extract the zip file and upload the extracted directory to your
PivotX site inside the `pivotx/extensions` directory.

NB! Make sure that your unzip program hasn't created an extra directory level.
The directory `pivotx/extensions/extensionname` should contain at least one
PHP file.
